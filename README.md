# ffmpeg-gui-pyqt6

This repository was created per user request. It contains the file `GUI_tkinter_WINFF.py` copied from https://github.com/mauriciomenon/FFmpegTJSP-WINFF/blob/main/GUI_tkinter_WINFF.py

Notes:

- The file in this repository is the original Tkinter script. The user requested the file to be added to a new repo named `ffmpeg-gui-pyqt6`.
- No automatic conversion from Tkinter to PyQt6 was performed. If you'd like, I can convert the GUI to PyQt6 and add it as a new file (e.g., `GUI_pyqt6_WINFF.py`).
